# Deprecated: Use `docs/TUI_V2_CONTRACT.md`

**Bead:** br-3vwi.1  
**Date:** 2026-02-10  
**Status:** Deprecated (superseded)

This file was an initial drafting scratchpad for the V2 product contract.

The canonical, actively maintained contract is now:

- `docs/TUI_V2_CONTRACT.md`

If you are working on any V2 track under `br-3vwi`, update and reference
`docs/TUI_V2_CONTRACT.md` (and keep it as the single source of truth).
