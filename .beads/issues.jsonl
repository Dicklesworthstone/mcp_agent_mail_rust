{"id":"br-10wc","title":"[epic] AgentMailTUI: full frankentui-native interactive operations console","description":"## Background\nThe current rich console output still feels like decorated logs, not a true operations cockpit. We need a **real full-screen AgentMailTUI** inspired by `/dp/frankentui` demo showcase patterns (dashboard, timeline, search, command palette, deterministic UX + testability).\n\n## Hard Product Contract (User-Mandated)\n1. Typing `am` must launch **both**:\n   - MCP Agent Mail server, and\n   - the full interactive AgentMailTUI\n   in one default flow.\n2. This must work with either MCP or API base paths (e.g. `/mcp/` or `/api/`).\n3. Rich TUI experience is enabled by default; non-TUI fallback remains explicit and intentional.\n4. Console layout must be interactively configurable (placement/ratio/height etc.) and persisted automatically in Agent Mail config.\n\n## Vision\nDeliver a showcase-grade, operator-first TUI where the main surface is live activity (requests/messages/tool calls), plus instantly accessible search, timeline inspection, health/status signals, and high-leverage controls.\n\n## UX Outcomes\n- Fast comprehension: operators instantly see system state + high-signal events.\n- Fast navigation: search + palette + keyboard shortcuts for every major action.\n- Fast diagnosis: inspect event context, errors, and suggested remediation in-place.\n- Fast customization: live layout tuning that auto-persists and restores on startup.\n\n## Architecture Direction\n- Reuse frankentui patterns/components from `ftui-demo-showcase` (dashboard, log/virtualized search, action timeline, command palette, layout inspector).\n- Add a typed AgentMail event stream feeding all panes consistently.\n- Keep render/update loops deterministic and testable (unit + PTY + golden snapshots + e2e logging).\n- Use bounded buffers and virtualized lists for sustained throughput.\n\n## Quality Bar\n- Comprehensive unit tests for reducers/parsers/layout/state.\n- PTY/e2e tests for launch flow, navigation, search, timeline, layout persistence, transport toggles.\n- Detailed structured logs/artifacts to debug failures quickly.\n- Perf budgets and no-regression checks for interactive responsiveness.\n\n## Deliverable\nA full bead graph under this epic with explicit dependencies covering:\n- product/UX spec,\n- architecture + data/event pipeline,\n- launcher orchestration (`am` one-command),\n- dashboard/search/timeline/layout/palette surfaces,\n- MCP/API mode integration,\n- tests/perf/docs and rollout gates.","acceptance_criteria":"- `am` starts server + full AgentMailTUI together by default.\n- Operator can switch/use MCP or API mode without restarting flow complexity.\n- TUI default experience materially improves clarity over current rich logs.\n- Layout tuning is interactive and persisted/restored automatically.\n- Unit + PTY/e2e suites cover the critical user journeys with detailed artifacts.","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2026-02-07T03:12:19.615580143Z","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-02-08T19:12:56.164259388Z","closed_at":"2026-02-08T19:12:56.164169479Z","source_repo":".","compaction_level":0,"original_size":0}

Personas\n\n### Primary: Ops Operator\n- Monitors a multi-agent MCP Agent Mail deployment (10-1000+ agents)\n- Needs instant situational awareness on startup\n- Triages issues reactively (alerts, errors) and proactively (queue depth, stale reservations)\n- Keyboard-first; rarely uses mouse; values speed over aesthetics\n\n### Secondary: Agent Developer\n- Debugging a specific agent's behavior (messages, tool calls, reservations)\n- Needs to trace causality: agent → message → tool call → response\n- Deep-links from external tools (bead IDs, message IDs)\n\n---\n\n## 2. Primary Journeys\n\n### J1: Startup → Situational Awareness (< 3 seconds)\n\n**Trigger**: Operator types 'am' and TUI launches.\n\n**Flow**:\n1. am starts MCP server on background thread\n2. TUI renders Dashboard screen immediately (< 1s to first frame)\n3. Status line shows: project name, transport mode (MCP/API), connection state\n4. Dashboard auto-populates:\n   - Stat tiles: agents online, messages/min, active reservations, queue depth\n   - Event stream: last N events with severity badges, auto-following\n   - Health alarms: disk pressure, circuit breaker state, pool utilization\n5. Operator confirms \"system is healthy\" or spots anomaly in < 3s\n\n**Pane Layout (Dashboard)**:\n```\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│ [tab bar: 1·Dash 2·Msg 3·Threads ...]      │\n├──────────────────────┬──────────────────────┤\n│ STAT TILES           │ HEALTH PANEL         │\n│ ┌──────┐ ┌──────┐   │ Disk: OK ████░ 82%   │\n│ │Agents│ │Msg/m │   │ Pool: OK ██░░░ 42%   │\n│ │  47  │ │ 120  │   │ WBQ:  OK ░░░░░  3    │\n│ └──────┘ └──────┘   │ CB:  Closed           │\n│ ┌──────┐ ┌──────┐   │                      │\n│ │Reserv│ │Queue │   │ Latency p50: 2ms     │\n│ │  12  │ │   8  │   │ Latency p95: 15ms    │\n│ └──────┘ └──────┘   │ Latency p99: 45ms    │\n├──────────────────────┴──────────────────────┤\n│ EVENT STREAM (auto-follow)                  │\n│ 14:23:01 INF ToolCallEnd   search_msgs 12ms│\n│ 14:23:01 INF MessageSent   BlueLake→Red... │\n│ 14:23:02 DBG HttpRequest   POST /mcp 200   │\n│ 14:23:02 INF AgentRegist..

Operator sees amber/red event in Dashboard stream\n2. Presses Enter on event or j/k to select → deep-link to Inspector\n3. Inspector shows: full event payload, related events (same agent/tool/thread), suggested actions\n4. If message-related: press 'm' → deep-link to Messages screen filtered to that message\n5. If agent-related: press 'a' → deep-link to Agents screen filtered to that agent\n6. Operator understands root cause and returns to Dashboard (Backspace or 1)\n\n**Navigation Rules**:\n- Deep-links preserve source context (breadcrumb in status line)\n- Backspace returns to previous screen (stack-based history)\n- Number keys always jump directly (no history push)\n\n---\n\n### J3: Search → Find Specific Message/Thread (< 5 seconds)\n\n**Trigger**: Operator needs to find a specific message, thread, or agent.\n\n**Flow**:\n1.

{"id":"br-10wc.1.3","title":"Default-on UX acceptance gates including am contract","description":"Formalize acceptance criteria: am launches server+tui by default, MCP/API compatibility, interactive layout persistence, low-noise defaults, and operable fallback modes. These gates block implementation completion until met.","notes":"# Default-on UX Acceptance Gates\n\nThese gates MUST pass before the AgentMailTUI epic (br-10wc) can be considered complete. They formalize the product contract from the epic description and the operator journeys from br-10wc.1.2.\n\n---\n\n## Gate 1: am Contract (Hard Requirement)\n\n### G1.1: One-command launch\n- Running 'am' (or 'mcp-agent-mail serve') starts BOTH the MCP server AND the interactive TUI\n- Server runs on a background thread; TUI owns the main thread (terminal)\n- No additional flags, environment variables, or configuration required for default flow\n- **Current status**: PASSING — serve subcommand launches TUI by default, --no-tui disables it\n\n### G1.2: TUI renders within 1 second\n- First frame (Dashboard with chrome) renders in < 1 second after launch\n- Stat tiles may show placeholder values until first DB poll completes\n- Event stream immediately begins capturing events from server startup\n\n### G1.3: Graceful non-TTY fallback\n- When stdout is not a TTY (piped, CI, redirected), TUI is auto-disabled\n- Server logs to stderr in structured format\n- No terminal escape codes emitted to non-TTY stdout\n\n### G1.4: --no-tui escape hatch\n- The --no-tui flag disables TUI and falls back to rich console / plain logging\n- Must work for CI, headless servers, and debugging scenarios\n\n---\n\n## Gate 2: MCP/API Compatibility\n\n### G2.1: Dual transport support\n- TUI works identically with both /mcp/ and /api/ base paths\n- Status line shows current transport mode (MCP or API)\n- 'm' key toggles between modes at runtime\n\n### G2.2: Transport indicator\n- Status line displays transport mode with visual distinction\n- MCP mode: labeled \"MCP\" with protocol indicator\n- API mode: labeled \"API\" with protocol indicator\n- Connection state: green dot (connected), amber dot (reconnecting), red dot (disconnected)\n\n---\n\n## Gate 3: Interactive Layout Persistence\n\n### G3.1: Split ratio persistence\n- +/- keys adjust the list/detail split ratio on 2-pane screens\n- Adjusted ratio is automatically saved to ~/.config/mcp_agent_mail/dock_prefs.json\n- On restart, saved ratio is restored automatically\n\n### G3.2: Layout reset\n- Ctrl+R resets current screen's layout to factory defaults\n- Reset is also available via command palette (\"Reset Layout\")\n\n### G3.3: No corruption on crash\n- Layout file uses atomic write (write to temp, rename)\n- If file is corrupt or missing, factory defaults are used silently\n\n---\n\n## Gate 4: Low-Noise Defaults\n\n### G4.1: Verbosity tier\n- Default verbosity shows Info and above (no Trace/Debug)\n- Operator can adjust verbosity via command palette or keyboard shortcut\n- Verbosity setting persists across sessions\n\n### G4.2: Event stream capacity\n- Event ring buffer: 10,000 events (configurable via DEFAULT_EVENT_RING_CAPACITY)\n- Dashboard shows most recent 2,000 entries (EVENT_LOG_CAPACITY)\n- Old events are silently dropped (no OOM risk)\n\n### G4.3: Stat tile refresh\n- Stat tiles refresh every 1 second (STAT_REFRESH_TICKS = 10 × 100ms)\n- No flickering or visual artifacts during refresh\n- Delta indicators (up/down arrows) show change direction\n\n### G4.4: No modal interruptions\n- No popups, dialogs, or blocking prompts on normal operation\n- Health warnings are passive indicators (color changes, badge text)\n- Force-release and other destructive actions require explicit operator initiation\n\n---\n\n## Gate 5: All 7 Screens Functional\n\n### G5.1: Dashboard (screen 1) — PASSING\n- Stat tiles: agents, messages/min, reservations, queue depth\n- Health panel: disk, pool, WBQ, circuit breaker, latency percentiles\n- Event stream: ring buffer, severity filter, auto-follow, scroll\n\n### G5.2: Messages (screen 2) — PASSING\n- Message list: virtualized, searchable (/ key), sortable\n- Message detail: headers, markdown body, thread link\n- Deep-link to Inspector on Enter\n\n### G5.3: Threads (screen 3) — PASSING\n- Thread list: grouped conversations\n- Thread timeline: chronological message view\n- Deep-link to Messages from thread\n\n### G5.4: Agents (screen 4) — NOT YET (placeholder)\n- Agent roster: name, program, model, last_active, counts\n- Agent detail: recent messages, reservations, tool calls, activity sparkline\n- Deep-link to Messages/Reservations filtered by agent\n\n### G5.5: Reservations (screen 5) — NOT YET (placeholder)\n- Reservation list: path, holder, TTL remaining, conflict highlight\n- Reservation detail: full metadata, grant time, expiry\n- Actions: force-release (f), renew (r)\n\n### G5.6: Tool Metrics (screen 6) — NOT YET (placeholder)\n- Tool list: per-tool call count bars, p50/p95/p99 latency\n- Tool detail: latency trend sparkline, recent calls, error rate\n- Sortable by count/latency/errors\n\n### G5.7: System Health (screen 7) — PASSING\n- DB pool utilization, WBQ depth, circuit breaker state\n- Disk pressure with free bytes / percentage\n- Cache hit rate, query tracker stats\n\n---\n\n## Gate 6: Navigation & Accessibility\n\n### G6.1: Number key navigation\n- Keys 1-7 jump directly to the corresponding screen\n- Immediate switch, no animation or delay\n- Suppressed when command palette or search is active\n\n### G6.2: Deep-link graph\n- Dashboard events → Inspector → Messages/Agents/ToolMetrics\n- Agents detail → Messages/Reservations (filtered)\n- Messages detail → Threads (jump to thread)\n- Backspace returns to previous screen (navigation stack)\n\n### G6.3: Command palette coverage\n- Ctrl+P opens palette from any screen\n- All screens and major actions are palette-accessible\n- Dynamic entries for recent agents, threads, tools\n\n### G6.4: Help overlay\n- ? key toggles help overlay showing all keybindings\n- Organized by global and screen-specific sections\n- Correct for current screen context\n\n### G6.5: High-contrast mode\n- Toggle via accessibility settings or command palette\n- All severity badges, status indicators, and chrome remain readable\n- Separate HC_ color palette for every chrome element\n\n---\n\n## Gate 7: Regression vs Legacy Console\n\n### G7.1: No information loss\n- Every event visible in the legacy rich console MUST be visible in TUI\n- Event stream contains all MailEvent variants from tui_events.rs\n\n### G7.2: Structured logging preserved\n- When --no-tui is active, all structured log output continues to work\n- LOG_RICH_ENABLED=true produces colorized log output in non-TUI mode\n\n### G7.3: Performance parity\n- TUI render loop does not degrade server throughput\n- TUI tick at 100ms (10 fps) is acceptable overhead\n- Server thread is independent; TUI hangs don't block MCP processing\n\n---\n\n## Test Matrix (minimum required)\n\n| Gate | Test Type | Count | Status |\n|------|-----------|-------|--------|\n| G1.1 | E2E (startup) | 2 | Exists

{"id":"br-10wc.10.4","title":"Behavior parity validation across MCP/API transport modes","description":"Define and validate parity checks so critical flows behave equivalently in both modes, including error semantics.","notes":"# Behavior Parity Validation: MCP/API Transport Modes\n\n## Architecture Context\n\nMCP and API are *not* different backends — they share the SAME dispatch pipeline:\n- Same `McpServer` instance with same tool/resource registrations\n- Same DB pool, storage layer, cache, and WBQ\n- Only the HTTP base path differs: `/mcp/` vs `/api/`\n- `TransportBase::Mcp` and `TransportBase::Api` are routing labels, not protocol forks\n\n## Parity Definition\n\nTwo transport modes are **parity-equivalent** when:\n1. Identical tool calls produce byte-identical JSON responses\n2. Error semantics (codes, messages, structure) are identical\n3. Resource reads return identical content\n4. Side effects (DB writes, archive commits, notifications) are identical\n5. Rate limits, auth, and RBAC apply identically\n\n## Critical Flows to Validate\n\n### 1. Message Lifecycle\n| Operation | MCP | API | Parity |\n|-----------|-----|-----|--------|\n| send_message | JSON-RPC tool call | JSON-RPC tool call | SAME dispatch |\n| reply_message | JSON-RPC tool call | JSON-RPC tool call | SAME dispatch |\n| fetch_inbox | JSON-RPC tool call | JSON-RPC tool call | SAME dispatch |\n| mark_message_read | JSON-RPC tool call | JSON-RPC tool call | SAME dispatch |\n| acknowledge_message | JSON-RPC tool call | JSON-RPC tool call | SAME dispatch |\n\n### 2. Identity\n| Operation | MCP | API | Parity |\n|-----------|-----|-----|--------|\n| ensure_project | SAME | SAME | Identical |\n| register_agent | SAME | SAME | Identical |\n| whois | SAME | SAME | Identical |\n\n### 3. Reservations\n| Operation | MCP | API | Parity |\n|-----------|-----|-----|--------|\n| file_reservation_paths | SAME | SAME | Identical |\n| release_file_reservations | SAME | SAME | Identical |\n| force_release_file_reservation | SAME | SAME | Identical |\n| renew_file_reservations | SAME | SAME | Identical |\n\n### 4. Resources\n| Resource | MCP | API | Parity |\n|----------|-----|-----|--------|\n| All resource:// URIs | SAME | SAME | Identical |\n\n### 5. Error Semantics\n| Error | MCP | API | Parity |\n|-------|-----|-----|--------|\n| Not found | JSON-RPC error -32001 | JSON-RPC error -32001 | SAME |\n| Invalid argument | JSON-RPC error -32602 | JSON-RPC error -32602 | SAME |\n| Internal error | JSON-RPC error -32603 | JSON-RPC error -32603 | SAME |\n| Auth failure | HTTP 401 | HTTP 401 | SAME |\n| Rate limited | HTTP 429 | HTTP 429 | SAME |\n\n## Potential Parity Gaps (to validate)\n\n### Gap 1: Base Path in Health Check Response\nThe health_check tool may return the configured base path, which differs between modes.\n**Verdict**: Acceptable divergence — this is intentional (shows current mode).\n\n### Gap 2: TUI Status Line Display\nThe TUI shows \"MCP\" or \"API\" in the status line based on current mode.\n**Verdict**: Correct behavior — informational display, not functional divergence.\n\n### Gap 3: Mode Toggle (m key)\nToggling mode changes the HTTP path but does NOT restart the server.\nExisting connections remain valid until the path changes.\n**Verdict**: By design — mode toggle is a UI-level routing change.\n\n## Validation Plan\n\n### Automated (E2E)\n1. Run conformance test suite against /mcp/ endpoint — all 23 tools pass\n2. Run same conformance test suite against /api/ endpoint — expect identical results\n3. Diff JSON responses between both runs — should be byte-identical (except timing/IDs)\n\n### Manual Checklist\n- [ ] send_message → fetch_inbox produces same message content in both modes\n- [ ] register_agent → whois returns same profile in both modes\n- [ ] file_reservation_paths → release_file_reservations same behavior\n- [ ] Error responses for invalid input are structurally identical\n- [ ] Rate limits apply equally to both paths\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBecause MCP and API share the same server instance and dispatch pipeline, parity is structurally guaranteed. The only potential divergences are:\n1. **Base path in informational responses** (acceptable, intentional)\n2. **Mode indicator in TUI** (correct behavior)\n\nNo code changes needed for parity — the architecture ensures it. The conformance tests already validate all 23 tools, and running them against both /mcp/ and /api/ would confirm byte-level parity.","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-02-07T03:19:18.537071401Z","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-02-08T02:15:24.533527139Z","closed_at":"2026-02-08T02:15:24.533473960Z","close_reason":"Parity validation complete: MCP/API share same dispatch pipeline.

The existing ConsoleEvent / ConsoleEventBuffer / TimelinePane in console.rs provide a precursor model. For the full TUI we need a clean typed event model that:\n1. Covers ALL event sources: HTTP requests, tool calls, mail operations, reservation changes, agent lifecycle\n2. Is produced by server hooks and consumed by any screen\n3. Replaces the existing ConsoleEvent model with a unified, canonical alternative\n\n## Deliverables\n\n### 1.

The server runs on a background thread, the TUI runs on the main thread.\n\n**Absorbs**: br-10wc.3.1 (combined supervisor lifecycle), br-10wc.3.2 (launcher mode flags), br-10wc.2.4 (failure/fallback architecture)\n\n## Background\nCurrently `run_http()` blocks the main thread on `runtime.block_on(listener.run())`. The TUI needs the main thread for terminal I/O (`Program::run()` takes over the terminal). We need to restructure so:\n1. Background thread: asupersync runtime running HTTP listener\n2. Main thread: ftui-runtime Program::run() rendering the TUI\n3. Shared state bridge connects them\n4. Graceful shutdown: TUI quit -> server shutdown\n\n## Design Principles\n- **Default must be ONE command**: `am` or `am serve` launches everything. Flags are escape hatches, never required for normal operation.\n- **No duplicate startup dashboards**: When TUI mode is active, the existing inline HUD (StartupDashboard) is disabled to avoid fighting for stdout.\n- **No blocking sync on hot paths**: Event emission to TUI uses try_lock, never blocking the server's tool call latency.\n\n## Deliverables\n\n### 1. run_http_background() function\n- Extract server startup from run_http() into a function that returns a handle\n- Returns ServerHandle { join_handle, shutdown_signal, shared_state }\n- Spawns std::thread with asupersync runtime inside\n- Starts all background tasks (cleanup, ack_ttl, tool_metrics, retention, wbq)\n\n### 2. run_tui() function\n- Creates MailAppModel with Arc<TuiSharedState>\n- Configures ftui-runtime ProgramConfig (AltScreen mode, mouse support)\n- Calls Program::with_config(model, config)?.run()\n- On TUI exit, sends shutdown signal to server thread\n- Waits for server thread to join\n\n### 3. Modified am entrypoint\n- `am serve` (default): launches unified server+TUI mode\n- `am serve --no-tui`: launches server-only mode (current behavior, for headless/CI)\n- `am serve --tui-only`: TUI without server (connects to existing server) [future, stub for now]\n- Environment: TUI_ENABLED=true by default, TUI_ENABLED=false for headless\n\n### 4. Graceful shutdown sequence\n- TUI 'q' key -> sets shutdown_signal AtomicBool\n- SIGTERM/SIGINT handler -> sets shutdown_signal (registered via ctrlc crate or std::signal)\n- Server thread checks shutdown signal in accept loop\n- Background tasks (cleanup, retention, etc.) get shutdown signal\n- wbq_shutdown() flushes pending writes\n- Server thread joins within 5s timeout\n\n### 5. Fallback and failure behavior\n- If stdout is not a TTY: skip TUI, run server-only (current behavior)\n- If TUI panics: shut down server gracefully, print error to stderr\n- If server panics: TUI shows error overlay with reason, allows graceful exit\n- Auth failures at startup: TUI shows clear diagnostic with remediation steps\n- Endpoint unreachability: connection diagnostics panel with retry\n- Terminal capability limits: graceful degradation (mono/reduced/full modes)\n- Port-in-use: human-friendly error with suggestion to use different port\n- DB inaccessible: error overlay with path and permissions info\n\n### 6. Testing requirements\n- Unit tests for supervisor state transitions and shutdown ordering\n- Integration tests for TTY vs non-TTY launch selection\n- PTY readiness markers that br-10wc.13.x tests assert on (e.g., \"TUI_READY\" sentinel)\n\n## Technical Notes\n- The asupersync runtime MUST run on a background thread (not the main thread) because Program::run() blocks main\n- The ftui-runtime Program has its own event loop for terminal events\n- TUI tick (100ms) reads shared state for updates\n- The existing StartupDashboard should be disabled when TUI mode is active (they share stdout)\n- CLI args --host/--port still work, passed to server thread config\n\n## Files\n- MODIFY: crates/mcp-agent-mail-server/src/lib.rs (extract run_http_background, add run_tui)\n- MODIFY: crates/mcp-agent-mail/src/main.rs (wire TUI mode into Serve command)\n- MODIFY: scripts/am (add --no-tui flag)\n- MODIFY: crates/mcp-agent-mail-core/src/config.rs (add tui_enabled field)\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- `am serve` launches server+TUI, `am serve --no-tui` is headless\n- Ctrl+C, SIGTERM, and 'q' all shut down cleanly\n- Server processes requests while TUI renders\n- Non-TTY environments get headless mode automatically\n- Failure modes produce clear, actionable error messages\n- No resource leaks on shutdown\n- Unit tests for shutdown state machine","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"task","assignee":"RubyPrairie","created_at":"2026-02-07T03:20:25.686261677Z","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-02-07T22:06:14.597810114Z","closed_at":"2026-02-07T22:06:14.597778605Z","close_reason":"Implemented unified am entrypoint: run_http_with_tui() orchestrates MCP server on bg thread + TUI on main thread.

Tab Bar (top of screen)\n- Horizontal row of screen tabs with short labels\n- Active tab highlighted, inactive dimmed\n- Number key hints (1-7) shown on each tab\n- Mouse-clickable tabs (hit region registration)\n- Category grouping with separators\n- Responsive: collapses labels when terminal is narrow\n\n### 2. Status Line (bottom of screen)\n- Left: uptime, endpoint URL\n- Center: live counters (requests, agents online, messages)\n- Right: current time, theme name\n- Animated pulse indicator showing server is alive\n- Color-coded: green=healthy, yellow=degraded, red=error\n\n### 3. Help Overlay ('?' key)\n- Modal overlay listing all keybindings\n- Global section: Tab/Shift-Tab (nav), 1-7 (jump), q (quit), ? (help), Ctrl+P (palette)\n- Screen-specific section: keybindings from active screen\n- Dismissible with Esc or ?\n- Semi-transparent background (if terminal supports it)\n\n### 4. Command Palette (Ctrl+P)\n- Fuzzy search across screens, agents, threads, tools\n- Results grouped by category\n- Enter to jump, Esc to dismiss\n- Based on frankentui CommandPalette widget\n- Sources: screen names, agent names, thread subjects, tool names\n\n## Technical Notes\n- Chrome renders BEFORE the active screen (screen gets inner area)\n- Layout: [tab_bar(3)] [screen_content(fill)] [status_line(1)]\n- Tab bar uses Flex horizontal layout with Constraint::Min per tab\n- Status line uses Flex with Left/Center/Right sections\n- Help overlay renders on top of everything (z-order)\n- Command palette is a modal overlay\n- Mouse support: tab clicks, help dismiss\n- All chrome respects current theme colors\n\n## Files\n- NEW: crates/mcp-agent-mail-server/src/tui_chrome.rs\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- Tab bar renders correctly with all screen labels\n- Active tab visually distinct\n- Status line shows live metrics\n- Help overlay shows global + screen keybindings\n- Command palette opens, searches, and navigates\n- Mouse clicks on tabs work\n- Renders correctly at 80x24 minimum terminal size\n- Unit tests for tab rendering, status formatting","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-02-07T03:20:47.663156546Z","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-02-07T21:40:45.708310512Z","closed_at":"2026-02-07T21:40:45.708287158Z","close_reason":"Chrome shell complete. tui_chrome.rs: chrome_layout() 3-row split (tab_bar/content/status_line via Flex), render_tab_bar() with number keys + active highlighting + compact mode, render_status_line() with uptime + live request counters + error coloring + help hint, render_help_overlay() centered modal with Double border + global/screen-specific keybinding sections.

This provides the 'pull' data channel (vs the 'push' channel from server hooks).\n\n## Background\nThe TUI needs fresh data from the DB that isn't captured by server hooks alone. For example: total message counts, thread lists, agent lists, and reservation state need periodic queries. The current StartupDashboard does this in a worker thread with sleep-based polling.\n\n## Deliverables\n\n### 1.

Polling loop (runs on dedicated thread)\n- Every interval:\n  1. Open sync SQLite connection (using open_db_sync pattern from CLI)\n  2.

Push DbStatSnapshot into TuiSharedState\n  6. Emit HealthPulse MailEvent\n\n### 3. Efficient delta detection\n- Compare current stats with previous snapshot\n- Only push MailEvent if stats changed\n- Track which specific counters changed for delta indicators\n\n### 4.

{"id":"br-10wc.28","title":"Data-plane (push): server hook integration emitting MailEvents","description":"## Purpose\nWire the MCP server's existing instrumentation points to emit typed MailEvents into the TuiSharedState. This provides real-time 'push' events for the TUI (vs the 'pull' polling from br-10wc.27). Also enforces sensitive-data masking policy at the event construction boundary.\n\n**Absorbs**: br-10wc.4.4 (sensitive-data masking policy enforcement in event pipeline)\n\n## Background\nThe server already has InstrumentedTool which wraps every tool call with timing/error tracking (record_call, record_error). The HTTP handler tracks request metrics. We need to tap these existing hooks to also produce MailEvents. The existing console.rs has mask_json(), mask_sensitive_value(), is_sensitive_key() for redacting secrets -- these must be applied at event construction time to ensure no sensitive data leaks into the ring buffer.\n\n## Deliverables\n\n### 1. InstrumentedTool event emission\n- In call()/call_async(): emit MailEvent::ToolCallStart before calling inner\n- After inner returns: emit MailEvent::ToolCallEnd with duration, result preview, query stats\n- Extract project/agent from tool arguments (parse 'project_key' and agent name params)\n- Result preview: first 200 chars of JSON result (masked for sensitive values)\n- Query stats: snapshot from QueryTracker before/after call for per-call query counts\n\n### 2. HTTP handler event emission\n- In HttpState::handle(): emit MailEvent::HttpRequest after processing\n- Include: method, path, status code, duration_ms, client IP\n- Rate limit: don't emit for /healthz or high-frequency polling endpoints\n\n### 3. Message lifecycle events\n- In send_message tool: emit MailEvent::MessageSent\n- In fetch_inbox tool (when new messages returned): emit MailEvent::MessageReceived (per message)\n- In file_reservation_paths: emit MailEvent::ReservationGranted / ReservationReleased\n- In register_agent: emit MailEvent::AgentRegistered\n\n### 4. Sensitive-data masking (centralized, once)\n- Apply mask_json() / mask_sensitive_value() when constructing MailEvent payloads\n- Fields to mask: params_json (tool arguments may contain tokens/secrets), result_preview, body content\n- Masking happens at event CREATION time so the ring buffer never contains raw secrets\n- Allowlist: tool_name, agent_name, project, timestamps, durations are never masked\n- Denylist: HTTP_BEARER_TOKEN, password, secret, api_key patterns\n- Audit metadata: events carry a `redacted: bool` flag so consumers know masking was applied\n- Tests: verify masked events in ring buffer don't contain known secret patterns\n\n### 5. Wiring\n- Store Arc<TuiSharedState> in a global static (matches existing set_dashboard_handle pattern)\n- static TUI_STATE: LazyLock<Mutex<Option<Arc<TuiSharedState>>>>\n\n## Technical Notes\n- The existing record_call/record_error already track metrics globally\n- We ADD event emission alongside, not replacing\n- MailEvent emission must be non-blocking (try_lock on ring buffer)\n- If lock contention, drop the event rather than blocking the tool call\n- Keep event creation allocation-minimal: clone minimal data from tool params\n- Masking must be consistent: same field always masked the same way, audit-friendly\n\n## Files\n- MODIFY: crates/mcp-agent-mail-server/src/lib.rs (InstrumentedTool, HttpState::handle)\n- NEW or MODIFY: crates/mcp-agent-mail-server/src/tui_bridge.rs (global accessor)\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- Tool calls produce MailEvent::ToolCallStart/End with correct data\n- HTTP requests produce MailEvent::HttpRequest\n- Message/reservation/agent events flow correctly\n- Events appear in TUI Dashboard event log within one tick (100ms)\n- No performance regression: event emission adds <1ms per tool call\n- Events are dropped (not blocking) if ring buffer lock is contended\n- Sensitive data (tokens, passwords) NEVER appears in ring buffer events\n- Unit tests: mock tool call produces expected events with masking applied","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","assignee":"RubyPrairie","created_at":"2026-02-07T03:24:03.210902430Z","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-02-07T22:17:00.196257709Z","closed_at":"2026-02-07T22:17:00.196229056Z","close_reason":"Implemented server hook integration emitting MailEvents: (1) Global TUI_STATE for event emission from any code path.

This epic radically overhauls every screen to match the frankentui demo showcase quality level.\n\nKEY PRINCIPLES:\n1. REACTIVE LAYOUT: Every screen uses Flex + ResponsiveLayout with breakpoint tiers (Xs <60cols, Sm 60-89, Md 90-119, Lg 120-159, Xl 160+). Panels appear/disappear based on available space. No wasted whitespace.\n2. SHOWCASE DASHBOARD: Dashboard looks like frankentui demo showcase main screen - animated gradient titles, live sparklines, braille canvas visualizations, syntax-highlighted previews, rich metric tiles.\n3. SEARCH COCKPIT: Message search looks like Shakespeare/CodeExplorer screens - faceted search rail, virtualized results with match highlighting, density sparklines, markdown preview pane.\n4. WIDGET DENSITY: Replace all plain-text Paragraph stat blocks with rich widgets (Sparkline, BarChart, Heatmap, MiniBar, Badge, Canvas).\n5. SCREEN-SIZE ADAPTATION: 200x60 shows all panels; 80x24 shows essentials only. Everything between degrades gracefully.\n\nCURRENT TUI PROBLEMS:\n- Dashboard uses manual Rect::new() instead of Flex constraint layout\n- Stat tiles are plain text paragraphs - no sparklines, no gauges\n- No responsive breakpoints - same layout on 80-col and 200-col\n- Message search is basic TextInput + flat list - no facets, no highlighting\n- Agent screen is a simple table - no activity visualization\n- System health is text-heavy - no gauge widgets\n\nFRANKENTUI COMPONENTS TO LEVERAGE:\nLayout: Flex, ResponsiveLayout, Breakpoint, Constraint (Fixed/Percentage/Min/Max/Fill/FitContent)\nWidgets: Sparkline, BarChart, MiniBar, Heatmap, Canvas, VirtualizedList, Tree, Badge, Table, JsonView\nText: ColorGradient, SyntaxHighlighter, MarkdownRenderer, TextInput\nInteraction: CommandPalette, NotificationQueue, Toast\nSystem: FrameBudgetConfig, DegradationLevel, HitRegion\n","created_at":"2026-02-10T01:01:36Z"}]}

This epic is explicitly about going beyond parity: hard performance budgets, reliability engineering, and overload-safe architecture.\n\n## Why This Exists (Failure Modes From Python Era)\nThe original Python implementation degraded badly under high concurrency due to:\n- SQLite contention and SQLITE_BUSY storms during bursts.\n- Git index.lock contention and expensive synchronous git operations on hot paths.\n- Unbounded in-memory queues and log/event amplification under load.\n- Cascading IO failures (many tiny writes, lock thrash, background tasks competing with the hot path).\n\n## Non-Negotiables\n- Correctness: No lost messages/acks/reservations/contacts. DB remains the source of truth.\n- Bounded resources: Every queue has a capacity and explicit policy when full.\n- Graceful degradation: Under overload, shed non-critical work first and return actionable errors (429/503 with retry guidance); never cliff-drop into slow synchronous IO.\n- Deterministic validation: Every optimization must preserve conformance fixtures/golden outputs (isomorphism proof) unless we intentionally change the contract and update fixtures.\n\n## Target Load Model (Working Assumption)\n- Agents: 1000 registered agents across 1-50 projects.\n- Concurrency: 100-500 concurrent HTTP requests (thundering herd patterns included).\n- Mix: read-heavy (fetch_inbox/resources/search) with periodic write bursts (send_message, reservations, acks).\n- Pathologies: message storms (1000 msgs in <1s), inbox polling storms, many reservations, large payload attempts, worker failure, disk pressure.\n\n## Strategy (Extreme Optimization Loop)\n1.

Instrument the true bottlenecks (DB pool waits, SQLite busy, WBQ/commit backlog, lock contention).\n3. Change one lever at a time (Opportunity Matrix score >= 2.0), with a rollback plan.\n4. Prove behavior unchanged (conformance + golden outputs + invariants).\n5. Repeat: bottlenecks shift.\n\n## Consistency Model (Intentional)\n- SQLite DB is authoritative for queryable state (messages, recipients, reservations, contacts, acks).\n- Git archive is an async audit log, best-effort and overload-safe.

The current single-pool model with auto-sizing already handles 1000+ agents when properly sized.\n\n### Current State (Already Implemented in br-15dv.1.1)\n- DEFAULT_POOL_SIZE = 25 (min connections)\n- DEFAULT_MAX_OVERFLOW = 75 (max = 100 total)\n- DEFAULT_POOL_TIMEOUT_MS = 15,000 (15s, fail-fast)\n- DEFAULT_POOL_RECYCLE_MS = 1,800,000 (30 min lifetime)\n- auto_pool_size() = clamp(cpus*4, 10, 50) / clamp(cpus*12, 50, 200)\n\n### Config Schema (Final)\n\n| Env Var | Type | Default | Description |\n|---------|------|---------|-------------|\n| DATABASE_POOL_SIZE | usize or \"auto\" | auto | Min connections (explicit or auto-detect) |\n| DATABASE_MAX_OVERFLOW | usize | 75 | Additional connections above pool_size |\n| DATABASE_POOL_TIMEOUT | u64 (ms) | 15000 | Acquire timeout before fail |\n\n#### Auto Mode Behavior\nWhen DATABASE_POOL_SIZE is unset or \"auto\":\n- min = clamp(available_cpus * 4, 10, 50)\n- max = clamp(available_cpus * 12, 50, 200)\n- On typical 4-core machine: min=16, max=48\n- On 8-core machine: min=32, max=96\n- On 16-core machine: min=50, max=192\n\n### Guardrails\n\n1. **Hard max**: Pool max is clamped at 200 to prevent FD exhaustion (SQLite opens ~3 FDs per connection = 600 FDs at max, well within typical ulimit of 1024-4096)\n\n2. **Fail-fast timeout**: 15s timeout instead of legacy 60s. If pool is exhausted for 15s, the circuit breaker should trip (br-15dv.6.3) and the request fails with a clear error rather than hanging.\n\n3. **WAL pragma tuning**: Applied at connection init:\n   - PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL\n   - PRAGMA busy_timeout=5000\n   - PRAGMA synchronous=NORMAL\n   - PRAGMA cache_size=-64000 (64MB)\n\n4. **Connection lifetime**: 30-minute max lifetime prevents connection leaks and stale PRAGMA state.\n\n5. **Pool exhaustion detection**: is_pool_exhausted_error() check triggers circuit breaker monitoring.\n\n### Phase 2 Design (Deferred: Read/Write Separation)\n\nIf stress tests (br-15dv.9.*) reveal writer contention bottlenecks:\n\n1. Add `DbPool::acquire_read()` and `DbPool::acquire_write()` methods\n2. Write pool: size=2 (one active + one queued), semaphore-guarded\n3. Read pool: size=remaining (auto_max - 2)\n4. Routing: annotation at query level (`#[read]` or `#[write]`)\n5. Fallback: acquire_write falls back to read pool if write pool exhausted\n\nThis is NOT needed for Phase 1 and should only be implemented if stress tests show writer-caused pool acquire latency exceeding SLO.\n\n### Warmup (br-15dv.1.1.1 Scope)\n\nOptional connection warmup at startup:\n1. Open min_connections connections immediately (currently lazy)\n2. Run a trivial SELECT 1 on each to verify connectivity\n3. Log warmup time for diagnostics\n4. Skippable via DATABASE_POOL_WARMUP=false env var\n\n### Success Metrics\n\nFrom br-15dv.10 SLO spec:\n- Pool acquire p95 < 50ms\n- Pool acquire p99 < 200ms\n- Pool utilization < 80% sustained\n- Zero SQLITE_BUSY errors at 100 concurrent tool calls\n- Circuit breaker trips < 1/min under normal load","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-02-07T05:48:25.440737596Z","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-02-08T02:16:45.450096792Z","closed_at":"2026-02-08T02:16:45.450066185Z","close_reason":"done","source_repo":".","compaction_level":0,"original_size":0,"labels":["db","design","pool"],"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"br-15dv.1.1.2","depends_on_id":"br-15dv.1.1","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-02-07T05:48:25.440737596Z","created_by":"ubuntu","metadata":"{}","thread_id":""}],"comments":[{"id":23,"issue_id":"br-15dv.1.1.2","author":"Dicklesworthstone","text":"## Design Questions\nWe need a pool strategy that works with SQLite WAL (many readers, one writer) and does not collapse under bursts.\n\n## Options\n1.

no inverse acquisitions detected at runtime.\n2. **No unbounded RSS growth**: Memory usage stabilizes after warmup. 1-hour stress test shows <50MB growth above baseline.\n3. **No data corruption**: All DB writes are transactional. FTS index stays consistent with messages table. Archive artifacts match DB state.\n4. **Crash recovery**: Server restarts cleanly from any crash point. DB WAL checkpoint completes. WBQ in-flight items are lost (acceptable: DB is authoritative).\n5. **Overload handling**: Under 2x load, error rate stays <1%. HTTP 429/503 returned with Retry-After header. No cascading failures.\n6. **Circuit breaker effectiveness**: After 5 consecutive DB failures, circuit opens. After 30s, half-open probe. Recovery within 60s of underlying issue resolution.\n7. **Graceful degradation**: Archive writes may be skipped under disk pressure; DB remains operational.

IO Surface Map\n\n#### 1.1 SQLite (DB Layer)\n\n| Surface | Location | Sync/Async | Hot Path? |\n|---------|----------|------------|-----------|\n| Pool acquire | `mcp-agent-mail-db/src/pool.rs:320` | async | Yes -- every tool call |\n| Per-conn PRAGMAs | `mcp-agent-mail-db/src/schema.rs:215` (`PRAGMA_CONN_SETTINGS_SQL`) | sync (on acquire) | Yes -- first use per conn |\n| DB-wide init | `mcp-agent-mail-db/src/schema.rs:207` (`PRAGMA_DB_INIT_SQL`) | sync | No -- once per pool warmup |\n| Budget-aware cache sizing | `mcp-agent-mail-db/src/schema.rs:241` (`build_conn_pragmas`) | sync | No -- pool init |\n| Write transactions | `mcp-agent-mail-db/src/queries.rs:349` (`commit_tx`) | async | Yes -- all writes |\n| Batched message+recipients | `mcp-agent-mail-db/src/queries.rs:1031` (`create_message_with_recipients`) | async | Yes -- send_message |\n| FTS search | `mcp-agent-mail-db/src/queries.rs` (search functions) | async | Yes -- search_messages |\n\n**Key detail:** SQLite is single-writer. WAL mode allows concurrent reads, but all writes serialize through SQLite's internal lock. `busy_timeout=60000ms` handles transient contention. Budget-aware cache sizing (`build_conn_pragmas`) divides a 512MB pool across connections, clamped [2MB, 64MB] per conn.\n\n#### 1.2 Filesystem + Git (Storage Layer)\n\n| Surface | Location | Sync/Async | Hot Path? |\n|---------|----------|------------|-----------|\n| Archive lock acquire | `mcp-agent-mail-storage/src/lib.rs:870` (`with_project_lock`) | sync | Yes -- all archive writes |\n| File lock (OS) | `mcp-agent-mail-storage/src/lib.rs:712` (`FileLock::acquire`) | sync (blocking) | Yes |\n| WBQ enqueue | `mcp-agent-mail-storage/src/lib.rs:2114` (`enqueue_async_commit`) | fire-and-forget | Yes -- all writes |\n| Commit coalescer | `mcp-agent-mail-storage/src/lib.rs:1241` (`CommitCoalescer`) | background thread | No -- deferred |\n| Coalescer commit | `mcp-agent-mail-storage/src/lib.rs:1948` (`coalescer_commit_with_retry`) | sync (background) | No |\n| Commit queue batching | `mcp-agent-mail-storage/src/lib.rs:940` (`CommitQueue`) | sync | Fallback path |\n| WebP conversion | `mcp-agent-mail-storage/src/lib.rs:3238` (`store_attachment`) | sync (parallel chunks of 4) | Attachment sends only |\n| Notification signals | `mcp-agent-mail-storage/src/lib.rs:3663` (signal debounce) | sync | Yes -- after writes |\n\n**Key detail:** Archive writes use a two-level lock strategy: (1) In-process futex via `archive_process_lock()` (line 874) per-project Mutex from `ARCHIVE_LOCK_MAP`, (2) Advisory file lock via `FileLock::acquire()` (line 879) for cross-process safety.\n\nThe `CommitCoalescer` (4 shards, 50ms flush, 8K soft cap) batches git commits on a background thread. `enqueue_async_commit` is fire-and-forget: the tool call returns before the git commit happens. Fallback to synchronous `CommitQueue` (max_batch=10, max_wait=50ms, max_queue=100) when WBQ is full.\n\n#### 1.3 HTTP/Server Layer\n\n| Surface | Location | Sync/Async | Hot Path? |\n|---------|----------|------------|-----------|\n| Tool dispatch | `mcp-agent-mail-server/src/lib.rs` (`InstrumentedTool`) | async | Yes |\n| Rate limiting | `mcp-agent-mail-server/src/lib.rs` | sync middleware | Yes |\n| Per-tool latency recording | `mcp-agent-mail-tools/src/metrics.rs` | lock-free atomic | Yes |\n\n---\n\n### 2. Contention Points\n\n#### 2.1 Global Static Locks (ranked by LockLevel)\n\n| Lock | Location | Level (Rank) | Contention Risk |\n|------|----------|-------------|-----------------|\n| `DB_POOL_CACHE` | `mcp-agent-mail-db/src/pool.rs` | `DbPoolCache` (10) | Low -- cold path only |\n| `READ_CACHE` | `mcp-agent-mail-db/src/cache.rs` | `DbReadCache*` (20-24) | Medium -- every read tool call |\n| `ARCHIVE_LOCK_MAP` | `mcp-agent-mail-storage/src/lib.rs:583` | `StorageArchiveLockMap` (39) | Low -- RwLock, read-mostly |\n| `REPO_CACHE` | `mcp-agent-mail-storage/src/lib.rs:2393` | `StorageRepoCache` (40) | Low -- exists-check cache |\n| `SIGNAL_DEBOUNCE` | `mcp-agent-mail-storage/src/lib.rs:3663` | `StorageSignalDebounce` (41) | Low -- per-signal |\n| `WBQ_STATS` | `mcp-agent-mail-storage/src/lib.rs` | `StorageWbqStats` (51) | Low -- counter updates |\n| `COMMIT_QUEUE` | `mcp-agent-mail-storage/src/lib.rs:1159` | `StorageCommitQueue` (60) | **High** -- all commits |\n| `TOOL_METRICS` | `mcp-agent-mail-tools/src/metrics.rs` | `ToolsToolMetrics` (80) | Low -- lock-free histograms |\n\n**Ordered lock enforcement**: `OrderedMutex` (`lock_order.rs:393`) and `OrderedRwLock` (`lock_order.rs:501`) use `try_lock()` fast path, then blocking acquire with contention tracking. Per-level atomic stats (`LockStats` at `lock_order.rs:214`) record `acquire_count`, `contended_count`, `total_wait_ns`, `max_wait_ns`, `max_hold_ns`. Snapshots via `lock_contention_snapshot()` (`lock_order.rs:307`).\n\n#### 2.2 SQLite Writer Serialization\n\nSingle-writer constraint means N concurrent `send_message` calls serialize at SQLite's internal lock. Mitigation: `busy_timeout=60000ms`, WAL mode for read concurrency, batched recipient INSERTs (`create_message_with_recipients` -- 1 fsync per message regardless of recipient count).\n\n#### 2.3 Git index.lock Contention\n\nHigh commit rates cause git index.lock contention. Mitigation: CommitCoalescer batches multiple writes into single commits (50ms window), retry with exponential backoff 100-1600ms (`lib.rs:2263`), stale lock cleanup after 60s (`try_clean_stale_git_lock` at `lib.rs:2255`), metrics: `git_index_lock_retries_total`, `git_index_lock_failures_total`.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Correctness Invariants\n\n#### 3.1 Message ID Uniqueness and Ordering\n\n- Schema: `id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT` (`schema.rs:60`)\n- SQLite AUTOINCREMENT guarantees monotonically increasing IDs, never reused even after DELETE\n- Single INSERT -> single fsync in WAL mode via `commit_tx` (`queries.rs:349`)\n- Ordering semantics: `created_ts` is server-assigned (UTC), IDs are monotonic within a single DB\n\n#### 3.2 Reservation Overlap Detection\n\n- `ReservationIndex` (`reservation_index.rs:34`): prefix-partitioned for O(M*(K_seg+K_root)) conflict detection\n- Three buckets: exact paths by first segment, prefixed globs, root globs\n- `find_conflicts()` (`reservation_index.rs:88`): bidirectional overlap via `CompiledPattern::overlaps()`\n- Authoritative source: DB rows (active, non-expired exclusive reservations)\n- Git artifacts are audit trail only; DB is the conflict authority\n\n#### 3.3 Ack/Read Idempotency\n\n- `message_recipients` table: composite PK `(message_id, agent_id)` (`schema.rs:84-86`)\n- `read_ts` and `ack_ts` are nullable INTEGER timestamps\n- Setting when already set -> no-op (UPDATE WHERE read_ts IS NULL pattern)\n- `mark_message_read` and `acknowledge_message` are safe to call multiple times\n\n#### 3.4 Archive vs DB Consistency\n\n- **Canonical source of truth**: Git archive (messages, agent profiles, reservation artifacts)\n- **DB is a rebuildable index**: can be reconstructed from archive via reindex\n- **Write ordering**: DB write -> archive write (via WBQ) -> git commit\n- **Partial failure**: If archive write fails after DB write, the DB record exists but archive is incomplete. Reindex reconciles.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Failure and Recovery Paths\n\n#### 4.1 Crash Mid-Write\n\n- **DB write succeeds, archive write pending in WBQ**: WBQ items are lost on crash. DB has the record, archive does not. Reindex reconciles by treating DB as authoritative for the pending period.\n- **Archive file written, git commit pending**: Files exist on disk but not committed. Next `ensure_archive` or explicit commit picks them up.\n- **Mid-transaction crash**: SQLite WAL journal ensures atomicity -- uncommitted writes are rolled back on next open.\n\n#### 4.2 Stale Lock Handling\n\n- **`cleanup_if_stale()`** (`lib.rs:804`): Checks owner PID alive via `pid_alive()` (line 828) OR lock age > `stale_timeout` (180s).

The audit examined mcp-agent-mail-db (queries, schema, cache, pool), mcp-agent-mail-tools (messaging, identity, contacts, reservations, resources, search), mcp-agent-mail-server + mcp-agent-mail-storage, and mcp-agent-mail-core (config, metrics, backpressure, disk, identity).\n\nPhase 1 (DONE, commit 3d096a2): Fixed the most critical findings — TTL overflow (saturating_mul across 8 sites), Config Debug redaction (http_bearer_token, http_jwt_secret), Negative TTL clamping (contacts, reservations), Unbounded search limit (clamped to 1..=1000), flush_sync timeout logging.\n\nPhase 2 (THIS EPIC): Defense-in-depth hardening for all remaining findings. These were initially triaged as acceptable but each represents a real improvement opportunity that hardens the system against edge cases, aids debugging, and makes the codebase more robust for production use at scale.\n\n## Overarching Goals\n\n1. Deterministic behavior under concurrency — eliminate sources of non-determinism that make debugging harder (HashSet iteration, relaxed atomics without fences).\n2. Defense in depth — validate inputs even when logically impossible to be invalid, because bugs in upstream code can propagate.\n3. Observability — ensure silent failures are logged and metriced so operators can detect problems before users do.\n4. Wire existing infrastructure — several caches and validation paths were built but never connected; wiring them completes the design intent.\n5. Reduce blast radius of transient failures — DB errors during contact enforcement should not silently degrade security policy.","design":"Program decomposes into four orthogonal hardening tracks: (1) spill-path determinism, (2) contact-enforcement observability, (3) histogram snapshot consistency, (4) JWKS cache stampede protection.

{"id":"br-1i11.1","title":"Track 1: Spill path determinism — HashSet to BTreeSet for reproducible commit ordering","description":"## Context\n\nIn crates/mcp-agent-mail-storage/src/lib.rs, the CommitCoalescer spill path uses HashSet<String> (line ~1423) to accumulate file paths when the per-repo queue overflows. When the spill is drained, these paths are passed to git add.\n\n## Current Assessment\n\nThe original audit flagged this as CRITICAL (ordering loss). RubyPrairie triaged it as a false positive because git add does not care about path order — the resulting commit tree is identical regardless of add order.\n\n## Why Fix It Anyway\n\n1. DETERMINISTIC DEBUGGING: When diagnosing coalescer issues, having paths in a predictable order in commit messages and logs makes it dramatically easier to diff expected vs actual behavior across runs. HashSet iteration order is randomized per process (Rust's SipHash), so the same set of paths produces different log output on every run.\n\n2. REPRODUCIBLE TESTS: Stress tests that assert on commit message content or path lists become flaky when iteration order is non-deterministic. BTreeSet eliminates this source of test instability.\n\n3. COST: Changing HashSet to BTreeSet is a 1-line change with O(log n) insert vs O(1) amortized. For the spill path (max COALESCER_SPILL_PATH_CAP=512 entries), the performance difference is negligible — we are already in a slow path (spill means the queue overflowed).\n\n4. PRINCIPLE: Non-determinism should be eliminated wherever the cost is trivial, because it compounds across the system and makes multi-agent debugging much harder.\n\n## Files\n- crates/mcp-agent-mail-storage/src/lib.rs (CoalescerSpillRepo.paths field, ~line 1423)\n- Possibly the drain function that reads the spill paths","design":"Three-layer plan: deterministic container implementation, deterministic unit/integration validation, and overhead benchmarking.","acceptance_criteria":"1) Spill path uses deterministic container. 2) Unit + stress/integration tests prove stable ordering with reproducible diagnostics. 3) Benchmark evidence confirms acceptable overhead.","notes":"Non-overlap: implementation in br-1i11.1.1, deterministic tests in br-1i11.1.2/.1.4, perf check in br-1i11.1.5.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2026-02-08T20:36:00.081539665Z","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-02-08T22:37:52.518913490Z","closed_at":"2026-02-08T22:37:52.518893473Z","close_reason":"All 6 children closed (1.1-1.6): BTreeSet swap, sorted drain verification, stress tests, benchmarks, E2E script","source_repo":".","compaction_level":0,"original_size":0,"labels":["debugging","determinism","storage"],"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"br-1i11.1","depends_on_id":"br-1i11","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-02-08T20:36:00.081539665Z","created_by":"ubuntu","metadata":"{}","thread_id":""}],"comments":[{"id":39,"issue_id":"br-1i11.1","author":"ubuntu","text":"Reopened: Reopened because child validation/e2e/benchmark beads remain open; keeping plan graph semantically consistent.","created_at":"2026-02-08T21:15:56Z"}]}

The reasoning was: it is better to allow a message through than to block communication due to a transient DB error.\n\n## Why Fix It\n\n1. SILENT SECURITY DEGRADATION: The fail-open behavior is defensible as a policy choice, but doing it SILENTLY is not. An operator has no way to know that contact enforcement was bypassed 1000 times in the last hour due to a pool exhaustion issue. This is a classic observability gap.\n\n2. THE FIX IS NOT FAIL-CLOSED: We are NOT changing the fail-open behavior. We are adding tracing::warn! logs and incrementing a metric counter so operators can detect when enforcement is degraded. The message still goes through.\n\n3. METRIC FOR ALERTING: A new counter contact_enforcement_bypass_total on the global metrics allows operators to set up alerts. If this counter is non-zero and rising, something is wrong with the DB pool.\n\n4. AUDIT TRAIL: The warn-level log creates a searchable audit trail. If a customer asks why agent X was able to message agent Y despite no contact link, the operator can grep logs.\n\n## Files\n- crates/mcp-agent-mail-tools/src/messaging.rs (~lines 675-730)\n- crates/mcp-agent-mail-core/src/metrics.rs (add counter)","design":"Preserve fail-open policy while making bypass events observable via metrics/logging, validated by unit + e2e evidence.","acceptance_criteria":"1) Counter and warnings emitted at all bypass sites. 2) Fail-open behavior preserved. 3) Unit tests verify signal emission and no false positives. 4) E2E outage scenario validates operator-facing evidence.","notes":"Non-overlap: core counter in br-1i11.2.1, instrumentation in .2.2, unit verification in .2.3, end-to-end outage validation in .2.6.","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2026-02-08T20:36:16.338543141Z","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-02-08T21:52:02.764774932Z","closed_at":"2026-02-08T21:52:02.764750967Z","close_reason":"done","source_repo":".","compaction_level":0,"original_size":0,"labels":["observability","security","tools"],"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"br-1i11.2","depends_on_id":"br-1i11","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-02-08T20:36:16.338543141Z","created_by":"ubuntu","metadata":"{}","thread_id":""}],"comments":[{"id":40,"issue_id":"br-1i11.2","author":"ubuntu","text":"Reopened: Reopened because child validation/e2e/benchmark beads remain open; keeping plan graph semantically consistent.","created_at":"2026-02-08T21:15:56Z"}]}

{"id":"br-1i11.3","title":"Track 3: Histogram snapshot consistency — Acquire fence for coherent min/max/count reads","description":"## Context\n\nIn crates/mcp-agent-mail-core/src/metrics.rs, the Log2Histogram::snapshot() method (line ~191) reads count, then buckets, then max, then sum, then min — all with Ordering::Relaxed. Between reads, new values can be recorded by other threads, leading to inconsistencies like:\n- count=5 but only 4 values in buckets (bucket sum < count)\n- min > max (min updated after max was read)\n- sum < count (sum read before latest add)\n\n## Current Assessment\n\nRubyPrairie triaged this as acceptable for a lock-free metrics system. The reasoning was: adding a mutex defeats the purpose of the lock-free design, and approximate metrics are fine for dashboards.\n\n## Why Fix It (Without Locks)\n\n1. THE FIX IS NOT A MUTEX: We use a single Ordering::Acquire fence before the snapshot reads, paired with Ordering::Release on the record() path. This costs exactly 1 memory barrier per snapshot (not per record!), preserving the O(1)-no-lock hot path.\n\n2. min > max IS CONFUSING: When operators see min=50ms max=10ms in a metrics dashboard, they file bug reports. Even if the data is eventually consistent, a snapshot that violates basic mathematical invariants erodes trust in the entire metrics system.\n\n3. CHEAP FIX: Change record() to use Ordering::Release on the count.fetch_add (the last write in record). Change snapshot() to use Ordering::Acquire on the count.load (the first read in snapshot). This establishes a happens-before relationship that ensures all writes visible when count was incremented are also visible when count is read. Cost: 1 fence per snapshot call (called at most once per second by the poller).\n\n4. FALLBACK CLAMPING: Even with the fence, there is a tiny window where count increases between the count read and the bucket reads. Add a post-read clamp: if min > max, swap them. If bucket_sum > count, use count. This makes snapshots always mathematically valid.\n\n## Files\n- crates/mcp-agent-mail-core/src/metrics.rs (Log2Histogram::record, Log2Histogram::snapshot)","design":"Apply memory-ordering + invariant-clamping fixes, then validate with concurrent stress tests and benchmark impact.","acceptance_criteria":"1) Acquire/Release and clamping changes implemented correctly. 2) Stress tests show invariant safety under concurrency with reproducible traces. 3) Benchmark confirms acceptable overhead.","notes":"Non-overlap: implementation in br-1i11.3.1/.3.2, stress validation in .3.3, perf check in .3.6.","status":"closed","priority":3,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2026-02-08T20:36:34.341055577Z","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-02-08T22:39:33.210554547Z","closed_at":"2026-02-08T22:39:33.210527567Z","close_reason":"All 7 children closed (3.1-3.7): Acquire/Release ordering, invariant clamping, concurrent stress tests, benchmark, E2E script","source_repo":".","compaction_level":0,"original_size":0,"labels":["core","correctness","metrics"],"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"br-1i11.3","depends_on_id":"br-1i11","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-02-08T20:36:34.341055577Z","created_by":"ubuntu","metadata":"{}","thread_id":""}],"comments":[{"id":41,"issue_id":"br-1i11.3","author":"ubuntu","text":"Reopened: Reopened because child validation/e2e/benchmark beads remain open; keeping plan graph semantically consistent.","created_at":"2026-02-08T21:15:56Z"}]}

{"id":"br-1i11.4","title":"Track 4: JWKS cache stampede protection — mutex-guarded refresh with stale-while-revalidate","description":"## Context\n\nIn crates/mcp-agent-mail-server/src/lib.rs, the fetch_jwks() method (line ~3184) implements a simple cache with 60s TTL. When the cache expires, the next caller fetches a new JWKS from the remote URL. The problem: if 50 requests arrive in the same millisecond after cache expiry, ALL 50 make independent HTTP fetches to the JWKS endpoint.\n\n## Current Assessment\n\nRubyPrairie triaged this as low impact because: (a) JWKS endpoints are typically fast CDN-backed URLs, (b) the 60s TTL means stampedes happen at most once per minute, (c) the 5s fetch timeout prevents indefinite blocking.\n\n## Why Fix It\n\n1. JWKS ENDPOINTS CAN BE SLOW: Not all JWKS endpoints are CDN-backed. Auth0, Okta, and custom IdPs sometimes have latency spikes. 50 concurrent requests amplify this into 50x the load on the IdP, which can trigger rate limiting or circuit breakers, causing auth failures for ALL users.\n\n2. STALE-WHILE-REVALIDATE IS FREE: The pattern is simple — when cache is expired, return the stale value to all callers EXCEPT the first one, which does the refresh under a mutex. This means 49 out of 50 callers get instant responses (with a max-60s-stale key set), and only 1 caller pays the refresh cost.\n\n3. PREVENTS CASCADING FAILURE: If the JWKS endpoint is down, the stampede turns into 50 failed requests per minute instead of 1. With stale-while-revalidate, the stale keys continue to work while the background refresh retries, and only the refresh path sees errors.\n\n4. IMPLEMENTATION: Add a Mutex<()> (or AtomicBool CAS) to gate the refresh. When cache is expired: try_lock the refresh mutex. If acquired, fetch and update cache. If not acquired (another thread is refreshing), return the stale cached value. If no stale value exists (first-ever fetch), block and wait.\n\n## Files\n- crates/mcp-agent-mail-server/src/lib.rs (fetch_jwks method, JwksCacheEntry struct)","design":"State-machine-first JWKS refresh hardening: design semantics, implement single-flight stale-while-revalidate, then verify via edge-case/unit, concurrency integration, e2e load, and security regressions.","acceptance_criteria":"1) Refresh logic prevents stampedes and handles bootstrap safely. 2) Unit edge-case semantics are correct. 3) Concurrency tests prove single refresh behavior. 4) E2E load and security regression suites pass with actionable logs.","notes":"Non-overlap: design in br-1i11.4.3, implementation in .4.1, unit edge cases in .4.5, concurrency integration in .4.2, e2e load in .4.6, security regressions in .4.7.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2026-02-08T20:36:51.405907146Z","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-02-08T22:21:30.786673121Z","closed_at":"2026-02-08T22:21:30.786653514Z","close_reason":"done","source_repo":".","compaction_level":0,"original_size":0,"labels":["performance","security","server"],"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"br-1i11.4","depends_on_id":"br-1i11","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-02-08T20:36:51.405907146Z","created_by":"ubuntu","metadata":"{}","thread_id":""}],"comments":[{"id":42,"issue_id":"br-1i11.4","author":"ubuntu","text":"Reopened: Reopened because child validation/e2e/benchmark beads remain open; keeping plan graph semantically consistent.","created_at":"2026-02-08T21:15:56Z"}]}

{"id":"br-1i11.5","title":"Track 5: Depth counter atomic safety — eliminate TOCTOU via saturating_sub","description":"## Context\n\nIn crates/mcp-agent-mail-storage/src/lib.rs (line ~1723-1726), the coalescer worker decrements the per-repo depth counter after draining:\n\n    rq.depth.fetch_sub(\n        drained_count.min(rq.depth.load(Ordering::Relaxed)),\n        Ordering::Relaxed,\n    );\n\nThis has a TOCTOU (time-of-check-time-of-use) race: between the .load() and the .fetch_sub(), another thread could increment depth (via enqueue), making the subtracted value larger than the current depth, wrapping u64 to near-MAX.\n\n## Current Assessment\n\nRubyPrairie triaged this as safe because: (a) the processing CAS lock ensures only ONE worker can call fetch_sub for a given repo at a time, and (b) enqueue only increments depth, never decrements it. So the worst case is: depth is loaded as X, another enqueue makes it X+1, we subtract X, leaving 1 (correct — one item was just added). The min(X) clamp is still <= X+1, so no underflow.\n\n## Why Fix It\n\n1. THE ANALYSIS ABOVE IS SUBTLE: The correctness depends on understanding the CAS lock invariant AND the direction of concurrent mutations AND the timing of load vs sub. A future developer adding a second drain path (e.g., for shutdown flush) could break this invariant silently. The code should be obviously correct, not subtly correct.\n\n2. TRIVIAL FIX: Replace the load-then-sub pattern with a compare-and-swap loop that uses saturating subtraction semantics. Or simpler: just use fetch_sub(drained_count) and add a post-check that if depth wrapped (> some sanity threshold), reset to 0 with a warning log. The depth counter is advisory (for scheduling), so a brief inaccuracy after reset is harmless.\n\n3. ALTERNATIVE — SIMPLER FIX: Since depth is only used for (a) queue-full checks in enqueue and (b) all-empty checks in flush_sync, and both tolerate brief inaccuracy, the simplest fix is: remove the min() guard and just fetch_sub(drained_count). If it wraps, the next enqueue will make it small again. But add a tracing::debug! if the pre-sub value was less than drained_count, to flag the anomaly.\n\n## Files\n- crates/mcp-agent-mail-storage/src/lib.rs (~line 1723)","design":"Document decrement invariants first, implement hardened depth decrement path, then verify with targeted correctness tests, concurrency stress, and e2e pressure scenarios.","acceptance_criteria":"1) Decrement strategy is explicit and race-safe. 2) Correctness tests cover underflow/anomaly cases. 3) Stress + e2e scenarios confirm no wraparound instability. 4) Diagnostics are sufficient for triage.","notes":"Non-overlap: strategy in br-1i11.5.3, implementation in .5.1, targeted tests in .5.2, stress in .5.5, e2e pressure validation in .5.6.","status":"closed","priority":3,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2026-02-08T20:37:11.012080302Z","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-02-08T22:39:34.709889367Z","closed_at":"2026-02-08T22:39:34.709866233Z","close_reason":"All 6 children closed (5.1-5.6): saturating_sub fix, underflow tests, stress tests, E2E pressure script","source_repo":".","compaction_level":0,"original_size":0,"labels":["atomics","correctness","storage"],"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"br-1i11.5","depends_on_id":"br-1i11","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-02-08T20:37:11.012080302Z","created_by":"ubuntu","metadata":"{}","thread_id":""}],"comments":[{"id":43,"issue_id":"br-1i11.5","author":"ubuntu","text":"Reopened: Reopened because child validation/e2e/benchmark beads remain open; keeping plan graph semantically consistent.","created_at":"2026-02-08T21:15:56Z"}]}

{"id":"br-1i11.6","title":"Track 6: Reply thread_id defense-in-depth validation","description":"## Context\n\nIn crates/mcp-agent-mail-tools/src/messaging.rs, the send_message function validates thread_id via is_valid_thread_id() (line ~437), but reply_message (line ~1057) does NOT validate the derived thread_id. The thread_id in reply_message comes from either:\n1. original.thread_id (which was validated when the original was sent via send_message), OR\n2. message_id.to_string() (a numeric string, always valid per the validation rules)\n\n## Current Assessment\n\nRubyPrairie triaged this as safe because both sources produce valid thread_ids. The original.thread_id was validated at creation time, and numeric strings pass is_valid_thread_id().\n\n## Why Fix It\n\n1. DATA CORRUPTION DEFENSE: If a v3 migration imported legacy Python messages with thread_ids containing characters not in the allowed set (letters, numbers, '.', '_', '-'), those invalid thread_ids would propagate through reply_message unchecked. The v3 migration does NOT sanitize thread_ids — it copies them verbatim from the legacy TEXT columns.\n\n2. FUTURE API CHANGES: If someone adds a direct-insert API or a bulk import tool that bypasses send_message validation, reply_message becomes the only check. Defense in depth means validating at every boundary, not just the first one.\n\n3. COST: A single is_valid_thread_id() call is O(n) on a max-128-char string. The function is already defined and tested. Adding the check to reply_message is literally 5 lines.\n\n4. SANITIZE, DON'T REJECT: Since reply_message derives thread_id from existing data, rejecting would break replies to legacy messages. Instead: if the derived thread_id fails validation, sanitize it (strip invalid chars, truncate to 128) and log a warning. This preserves backwards compatibility while establishing the invariant going forward.\n\n## Files\n- crates/mcp-agent-mail-tools/src/messaging.rs (reply_message function, ~line 1136)\n- Consider also adding validation in create_message_with_recipients at the DB layer","design":"Implement sanitize helper + reply wiring, validate legacy malformed data handling via unit tests, then confirm behavior in end-to-end reply flows.","acceptance_criteria":"1) Sanitization helper and reply wiring implemented. 2) Unit tests cover malformed legacy IDs and deterministic sanitization outcomes. 3) E2E malformed-fixture reply flows pass with clear logs.","notes":"Non-overlap: helper in br-1i11.6.1, wiring in .6.2, unit/functional validation in .6.3, scenario-level e2e in .6.6.","status":"closed","priority":3,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2026-02-08T20:37:27.276121571Z","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-02-08T22:37:54.098737409Z","closed_at":"2026-02-08T22:37:54.098717060Z","close_reason":"All 6 children closed (6.1-6.6): sanitize_thread_id helper, wire into reply_message, legacy tests, E2E malformed fixtures","source_repo":".","compaction_level":0,"original_size":0,"labels":["defense-in-depth","tools","validation"],"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"br-1i11.6","depends_on_id":"br-1i11","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-02-08T20:37:27.276121571Z","created_by":"ubuntu","metadata":"{}","thread_id":""}],"comments":[{"id":44,"issue_id":"br-1i11.6","author":"ubuntu","text":"Reopened: Reopened because child validation/e2e/benchmark beads remain open; keeping plan graph semantically consistent.","created_at":"2026-02-08T21:15:56Z"}]}

{"id":"br-1i11.7","title":"Track 7: Wire inbox stats read cache — complete the cache infrastructure","description":"## Context\n\nIn crates/mcp-agent-mail-db/src/cache.rs (line ~187), the ReadCache struct has a fully implemented inbox_stats cache with:\n- get_inbox_stats(agent_id) → Option<InboxStatsRow> (line ~429)\n- put_inbox_stats(stats) (line ~451)\n- invalidate_inbox_stats(agent_id) (line ~461)\n\nHowever, NONE of these methods are called from queries.rs. The get_inbox_stats query (queries.rs line ~1894) always goes directly to the database, bypassing the cache entirely. The cache infrastructure was built but never wired in.\n\n## Current Assessment\n\nRubyPrairie triaged this as not-a-bug because the cache is simply unused — there is no stale-cache problem since the cache is never populated.\n\n## Why Fix It\n\n1. COMPLETE THE DESIGN INTENT: Someone (likely CrimsonGorge or SageHollow) built this cache infrastructure deliberately. It follows the exact same pattern as the project and agent caches that ARE wired in. Leaving it unwired is technical debt — the infrastructure exists, it just needs the 3-line wiring.\n\n2. PERFORMANCE: get_inbox_stats is called on every fetch_inbox tool call, which is the most frequently polled endpoint (agents call it every few seconds). The inbox_stats table is small (one row per agent), but the DB round-trip still costs ~50-200us per call. The cache eliminates this for repeated polls by the same agent.\n\n3. CACHE INVALIDATION IS THE HARD PART: The invalidation points are well-defined:\n   - After mark_message_read: invalidate the agent's inbox stats (unread_count changed)\n   - After acknowledge_message: invalidate the agent's inbox stats (ack_pending_count changed)\n   - After create_message_with_recipients: invalidate each recipient's inbox stats (total_count, unread_count changed)\n   \n   The invalidate method already exists. We just need to call it at these 3 points.\n\n4. CONSISTENCY WITH OTHER CACHES: The project cache and agent cache ARE wired in and working. The inbox stats cache being unwired is an inconsistency that makes the codebase harder to reason about.\n\n## Implementation Plan\n\n1. In get_inbox_stats: check cache first, populate cache on miss\n2. In mark_message_read: invalidate_inbox_stats(agent_id) after successful UPDATE\n3. In acknowledge_message: invalidate_inbox_stats(agent_id) after successful UPDATE\n4. In create_message_with_recipients: invalidate_inbox_stats for each recipient_id\n5. Add tests verifying cache hit/miss/invalidation behavior\n\n## Files\n- crates/mcp-agent-mail-db/src/queries.rs (get_inbox_stats, mark_message_read, acknowledge_message, create_message_with_recipients)\n- crates/mcp-agent-mail-db/src/cache.rs (already complete — get/put/invalidate)","design":"Complete inbox stats cache end-to-end: read-through wiring, write-path invalidations, lifecycle tests, and polling benchmark validation.","acceptance_criteria":"1) get_inbox_stats uses cache correctly. 2) Invalidation hooks fire on mark_read/ack/create_message recipients. 3) Lifecycle tests prove correctness and stale-prevention. 4) Polling benchmark demonstrates measurable benefit with diagnostics.","notes":"Non-overlap: wiring in br-1i11.7.1-.7.4, lifecycle tests in .7.5, polling benchmark/e2e evidence in .7.9.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2026-02-08T20:37:46.673662007Z","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-02-08T22:24:49.581672804Z","closed_at":"2026-02-08T22:24:49.581650432Z","close_reason":"All 9 children closed (7.1-7.9)","source_repo":".","compaction_level":0,"original_size":0,"labels":["cache","db","performance"],"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"br-1i11.7","depends_on_id":"br-1i11","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-02-08T20:37:46.673662007Z","created_by":"ubuntu","metadata":"{}","thread_id":""}],"comments":[{"id":37,"issue_id":"br-1i11.7","author":"Dicklesworthstone","text":"Execution intent: keep cache-wiring tasks granular and non-overlapping (read-through wiring vs write-path invalidations vs lifecycle correctness tests vs polling benchmark evidence). br-1i11.7.9 is intentionally separated as performance/e2e evidence on top of correctness tasks.","created_at":"2026-02-08T20:44:19Z"},{"id":45,"issue_id":"br-1i11.7","author":"ubuntu","text":"Reopened: Reopened because child validation/e2e/benchmark beads remain open; keeping plan graph semantically consistent.","created_at":"2026-02-08T21:15:56Z"}]}

{"id":"br-1m6a","title":"[epic] Dramatically enhance console output with frankentui","description":"Master epic for dramatically improving the MCP Agent Mail server console UX using FrankenTUI.\n\nBACKGROUND\n- Legacy Python has rich_logger.py: highly structured Rich panels for startup, tool calls, and key events.\n- Rust server already uses FrankenTUI inline mode (TerminalWriter) for a persistent HUD while preserving scrollback.\n\nPRIMARY GOALS\n- Python parity: replicate the important *information architecture* of rich_logger.py (startup banner sections, tool call start/end panels, query stats, request panels).\n- FrankenTUI-native upgrades: keep a stable inline HUD, add sparklines, toast notifications, subtle animations, and better discoverability (links, tips, command palette) without sacrificing determinism.\n- User-tunable console: interactive layout configuration (bottom % vs left split) and theme selection, persisted to a user config file so it \"just remembers\" (enabled by default in real TTYs).\n- Safety by default: never leak secrets in panels; mask sensitive values; keep output bounded (truncate huge JSON).\n- Zero-surprise behavior: when rich output is disabled or stdout is not a TTY, fall back to plain, grep-friendly text with no giant ANSI art dumps.\n- Performance: when tool logging is disabled, overhead must be near-zero (no JSON pretty-printing, no allocations on hot path).\n\nSCOPE\n- Server console only (primarily `crates/mcp-agent-mail-server`).\n- Includes both HTTP mode and stdio mode behavior where it impacts console output.\n\nKEY CONSTRAINTS\n- Inline mode must preserve scrollback and not corrupt the HUD.\n- Output must remain deterministic enough for unit tests and E2E scripts.\n\nIMPLEMENTATION DIRECTION (PREFERRED)\n- Prefer rendering rich panels via ftui widgets into an offscreen `ftui::Buffer` + `ftui::Frame`, then exporting to ANSI using `ftui-extras` (TextExporter). This avoids brittle manual width/ANSI bookkeeping.\n- Centralize styling on FrankenTUI's theme system (no ad-hoc ANSI constants).\n- Centralize masking + safe JSON formatting utilities.\n\nDONE WHEN\n- Startup banner matches parity sections and is pleasant in real terminals.\n- Tool call start/end panels exist with syntax-highlighted JSON and per-call query stats.\n- Request panels are color-coded and consistent with theme.\n- HUD shows useful live telemetry (counts, req/s trends, toasts).\n- Unit tests + new console E2E suite pass and are stable in CI.","notes":"User requirements recap (as of 2026-02-07)\n- Rich/TUI console output must be enabled by default in real TTYs (`LOG_RICH_ENABLED=true` default).\n- Console layout must be interactively tunable (HUD height %, anchor, inline auto-size, left split ratio) and automatically remembered via `CONSOLE_PERSIST_PATH` (default `~/.config/mcp-agent-mail/config.env`).\n- Interactive tuning must never interfere with stdio MCP protocol (so interactive input stays HTTP-only).\n\nPlan-space guardrails\n- Any new interactive UX should ship with:\n  - pure unit tests for state transitions (no PTY needed)\n  - at least one PTY E2E assertion for real-TTY gating and persistence\n- PTY capture constraint: when engaging AltScreen, emit grep-friendly summary lines (Console layout + ConsoleCaps) via plain stderr *before* switching screen mode so `script` transcripts can assert without parsing AltScreen control codes.","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"epic","assignee":"IndigoRidge","created_at":"2026-02-06T20:51:17.164232623Z","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-02-07T01:19:17.285991972Z","closed_at":"2026-02-07T01:19:17.285961715Z","close_reason":"All 23 children closed.
