//! Per-FM detector/fixer pairs for the world-class `am doctor` surface.
//!
//! Pass-8 introduces the FM (failure-mode) production pattern: each
//! detector is a pure function that scans system state and returns a
//! `Finding` list; each fixer takes a `Finding` plus a `MutateContext`
//! and routes its mutations through the chokepoint.
//!
//! Today the module hosts one concrete fixer
//! (`stale_archive_lock::detect` + `::fix`) as the reference pattern.
//! Pass-9+ adds the remaining priority FMs identified by Phase 3
//! synthesis (see `__doctor_workspace/analysis/dependency_graph.json`).
//!
//! Per AGENTS.md:
//! - No file deletion. Use `Op::Rename` to quarantine.
//! - asupersync only. Fixers are synchronous; the doctor runs out of
//!   band of the request hot path.
//! - `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`.
